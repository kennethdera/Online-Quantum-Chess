🎯 MEASUREMENT LOGIC FLOW

Measurement is triggered when:

A piece attempts to capture

A piece is being captured

A rule forces resolution (e.g., illegal overlap)

🧭 STEP 0 — Trigger

Event occurs:

Is a superposed or entangled piece involved?
    ├─ No → Resolve move normally (classical chess)
    └─ Yes → Proceed to Measurement
🧩 STEP 1 — Identify Quantum State Type
Is the piece:
    A) Superposed only?
    B) Entangled?
    C) Both superposed and entangled?
🔹 CASE A — Superposition Only
1. Retrieve list of possible squares
2. Retrieve probability for each square
3. Randomly select one square according to probabilities
4. Collapse piece to that square
5. Remove other instances
6. Continue move resolution

Done.

🔗 CASE B — Entangled (No Additional Superposition)

This means the piece is part of a joint state.

1. Retrieve full joint probability table
   Example:
       (A1, B3) → 0.4
       (A2, B4) → 0.6

2. Randomly select one joint outcome
3. Collapse ALL involved pieces to that joint state
4. Remove all other possibilities
5. Continue move resolution

Important:
You collapse the entire entangled system, not just one piece.

🔄 CASE C — Superposed + Entangled

This is the most general case.

1. Identify full entanglement group
2. Build complete joint state table
   (including all superposed positions)
3. Normalize probabilities (if needed)
4. Randomly select one joint outcome
5. Collapse ALL pieces in the group
6. Remove all other branches
7. Continue move resolution

This ensures:
✔ No partial collapse
✔ No inconsistent states
✔ Proper correlation preserved

⚔ SPECIAL: Measurement During Capture

If capturing piece is superposed:

1. Measure attacking piece first
2. Determine its real square
3. Check if capture is still valid
       ├─ If yes → Measure defender
       └─ If no → Move fails (turn ends)

If defending piece is superposed:

1. Measure defender
2. If defender exists on target square → capture succeeds
3. Otherwise → capture fails

If both are entangled in the same group:

Collapse entire entangled system first
Then resolve capture
♟ SPECIAL: Measuring a King

If measurement affects a king:

After collapse:
    Is king in check?
        ├─ Yes → illegal state? (depends on your rule)
        └─ No → continue

If all possible king states were in check → checkmate.
