🎲 Quantum Chess — Full Game Rules
1. Game Setup

Board: Standard 8×8 chessboard

Pieces: Each side starts with the normal 16 pieces

Turn Order: White moves first, then alternate

2. Game Modes
🌀 Classical Mode

Pieces move exactly as in regular chess.

⚛ Quantum Mode (Toggle with a key or command)

Pieces can perform quantum actions:

Split

Entangle

Measure

These create superposition and entanglement effects.

3. Quantum Principles in Play
🧩 Superposition

A piece can occupy two squares at once.

Visually, the piece shows on both squares, but neither is “real” until measured.

🔗 Entanglement

Two pieces can become linked so that the state of one affects the other.

🔍 Measurement

When a superposed or entangled piece is captured or forced to resolve, its state collapses to a definite square.

4. Quantum Actions
A) Split

A piece moves to two squares simultaneously.

Example: A knight in superposition could occupy b1 and c3 at the same time.

Cost: Using Split ends your turn.

Rules for Split:

The target squares must be legal destinations for that piece in classical chess.

The piece now exists as a superposition across those two squares.

B) Entangle

Entanglement links pieces so that they must collapse in correlated ways.

When does entanglement happen?

When a piece moves through (not stops on) a square occupied by another piece

When a split moving piece interacts with a target square occupied by another superposed piece

How entanglement works:

The pieces now share a quantum state.

If one is measured (collapses), the linked piece may also collapse or adjust according to the entanglement rule.

C) Measure

Measurement collapses superposition/entanglement to a definite state.

Measurement happens when:

A piece is captured

A piece is forced to resolve by an opponent’s move

Outcome:

The game randomly chooses one of the possible locations for the piece.

Any entangled partner must resolve according to their shared correlation.

5. Movement Rules
Classical Move

Works like regular chess

Quantum Move

Split Move: You choose two legal destination squares; the piece occupies both until measured.

Pass-Through Entanglement: If you move through an occupied square during a split or special move, entanglement occurs.

6. Capturing

A capture attempt may involve superposed pieces.

If the capturing piece is superposed, measurement happens before resolution:

Randomly choose which position is active

That position then captures the target

7. Collapse and Resolution

When a collapse triggers:

Decide randomly which possible square the piece actually becomes.

Replace the superposed piece with a normal piece on that square.

Remove all other superposed instances.

If entangled:

The partner(s) collapse according to predetermined correlation rules (e.g., opposite choices).

8. Check and Checkmate

A king in superposition can be in two squares.

A king is in check if any of its possible squares is attacked.

Checkmate happens when all superposed positions of the king cannot escape check.

9. Winning the Game

Traditional win conditions apply:

Checkmate your opponent’s king

Opponent resigns

Time runs out (if using clocks)
