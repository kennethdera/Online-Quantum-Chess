♟ Quantum Chess — Formal Move Declaration Rule
1️⃣ Move Commitment Principle

When a player declares a move, the move type is locked before any measurement occurs.

A move must be declared as exactly one of the following:

Classical Move

Capture Move

Split Move

Quantum Capture (if capturing a superposed piece)

The move type cannot change after measurement.

2️⃣ Resolution Order

All moves resolve in this strict order:

1. Declare move (type + target square(s))
2. Identify quantum involvement
3. Trigger measurement if required
4. Collapse affected quantum states
5. Validate declared move against new classical board state
6. Execute move if valid
7. Otherwise, move fails

No rollback is permitted after collapse.

3️⃣ Classical Move Declaration

If a player declares a non-capturing move:

If the destination square is empty after any required measurement → move succeeds.

If the destination square is occupied → move fails.

The move cannot convert into a capture.

4️⃣ Capture Move Declaration

If a player declares a capture:

Step A — Measurement Trigger

If the target piece is:

Superposed

Entangled

Or both

Measurement occurs immediately.

Step B — Collapse

All involved entangled pieces collapse according to joint probabilities.

Step C — Validation

After collapse:

If the target square contains an opponent piece → capture succeeds.

If the target square is empty → capture fails.

The capturing piece remains on its original square if the capture fails.

5️⃣ Split Move Declaration

When declaring a split:

Two legal destination squares must be specified.

Probabilities are assigned immediately.

The piece enters superposition.

Turn ends.

If measurement is triggered during the split resolution, collapse occurs before finalizing board state.

6️⃣ No Retroactive Move Conversion Rule

A declared move:

Cannot change from capture to non-capture.

Cannot change from non-capture to capture.

Cannot change target squares after measurement.

Measurement determines board reality — it does not modify the declared intent.

7️⃣ Irreversibility of Collapse

Once measurement occurs:

The board state updates permanently.

All non-selected branches are removed.

The previous state cannot be restored.

There is no FEN rollback.

8️⃣ Failed Move Consequence

If a declared move becomes invalid after measurement:

The moving piece remains on its original square.

The turn ends.

The collapsed board state remains in effect.

9️⃣ Multi-Piece Entanglement Clause

If a measured piece belongs to an entangled group:

The entire entangled system collapses simultaneously.

All pieces in the group update before move validation.

No partial collapse is allowed.

🔟 Check & Legality Clause

After collapse and move resolution:

Standard chess legality applies.

A move that results in self-check is illegal.

If collapse alone places a king in check, that is the new valid board state.
